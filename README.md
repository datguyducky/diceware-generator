# Diceware generator
Using weak password or passphrase is still most common mistake users do when securing their accounts and because of that I decided to make this website to show people that creating strong passwords/passphrases isn't really that hard. Memorizing them don't need to be hard and I will show it to you be using method called Diceware.

**Please remember that this project is only way to show people that there is way to create strong and memorizable passphrase and because of that I can't recommend using generated here passphrases as a way to secure your accounts.**

## What indicates strong passphrase?
* Long enough to be hard to guess.
* Not a famous quotation from literature, holy books, et cetera.
* Hard to guess by intuitionâ€”even by someone who knows you well.
* Easy to remember and type accurately.
* Not reused between sites, applications and other different sources.

## How Diceware works?
If you are interested how Diceware works with pshychical dice and paper - here you can read more.

If you wonder how this website uses Diceware to generate passphrases for users then this part is for you.

1. First we ask user to type how many words he want to have in his passphrase. The minimum amount of words is 6 and the maximum is 128.
1. Next user can choose in which language he want have his passphrase generated in. **There are currently 12 languages from which user can choose from.**
1. Then, when he hit the button to generate it - in no time is shows below this button.

These 3 steps above only describes what user sees but there isn't any explanation how all of this 'magic' works, so here it is:

1. Let's start with saying that everything described below happens just after clicking button by user (for ex. we know how many words user want to have generated after he click generate button, not when he is done typing it).
2. At the begining we gets how many words user want to have generated:
